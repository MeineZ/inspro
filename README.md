# Inspro

After implementing Peter Shirley's approach on Real-time ray tracing (in a weekend) in a pixel shader in [this](https://github.com/TeamWisp/DX12-raytracing-in-one-weekend) repo, I decided after a couple of months to implement this in a C++ application where I will learn about C++ patterns, multi-threading, and other CPU improvements that may improve the performance of this application. 

All feedback is greatly appreciated!
